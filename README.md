# Fall-Experiments
Python study with SVM and computer vision.

In a study using computer vision bases and SVM (Support Vector Machine), two authors' approaches (Kumar and Kasturi) were developed using different fall classification methods, the first using the approach elaborated by each one, and the second using SVM simple.
